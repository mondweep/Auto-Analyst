## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Generation

1. **Create Synthetic Data Models**
   - Define schemas for Vehicle Inventory, Market Data, Historical Sales, etc.
   - Ensure realistic relationships between different data models

2. **Implement Data Generation Script**
   - Create Python script to generate synthetic data
   - Ensure data has realistic patterns (seasonality, market trends, etc.)

3. **Generate Initial Dataset**
   - Run script to generate starter dataset for development

### 2. Backend Development

1. **Create New Schema Definitions**
   - Define Pydantic models for automotive data structures

2. **Implement API Routes**
   - Create routes for `/vehicles`, `/market-data`, `/recommendations`, `/opportunities`, etc.
   - Implement filtering, pagination, and sorting

3. **Integrate with Existing Chat System**
   - Extend the existing chat functionality to handle automotive-specific queries
   - Create prompt templates for automotive data analysis

4. **Add Analytics Features**
   - Implement market trend analysis
   - Add price recommendation algorithms

### 3. Frontend Development

1. **Create Dashboard Views**
   - Implement main dashboard with key metrics and visualizations
   - Add Buying Radar component to highlight opportunities
   - Create Daily Digest feed component

2. **Build Inventory Management**
   - Create vehicle inventory list with filtering and sorting
   - Implement detailed vehicle view with pricing insights

3. **Implement Recommendation Interface**
   - Create UI for viewing and acting on price recommendations
   - Add visualization of price positioning relative to market

4. **Add Market Opportunity Discovery**
   - Build interface for discovering acquisition opportunities
   - Implement filtering and sorting of opportunities

5. **Enhance Chat Interface**
   - Customize chat interface for automotive-specific queries
   - Add example queries and suggestions

### 4. Integration

1. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Configure API endpoints
   - Implement authentication and authorization

2. **Test End-to-End Functionality**
   - Verify data flow through the entire system
   - Test all main user scenarios

### 5. Deployment

1. **Package Application**
   - Create Docker containers for easy deployment
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Prepare Demo Environment**
   - Set up demo instance with pre-populated data
   - Create test accounts

## Phase 1: Initial Setup (1-2 days)

- [ ] Create documentation for demo participants

## Technical Considerations

### Data Processing

The system needs to:
- Process vehicle inventory data
- Calculate market positioning for each vehicle
- Generate price recommendations based on market data
- Identify acquisition opportunities
- Track historical performance

### AI Integration

The chat system should be enhanced to:
- Understand automotive terminology
- Answer questions about specific vehicles
- Provide pricing insights
- Suggest actions based on market trends
- Create visualizations of relevant data

### Performance Optimization

For a responsive demo experience:
- Implement efficient filtering and pagination
- Pre-compute common analytics
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize chart rendering
- Use lazy loading for images and components

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Routine

A dealer starts their day by reviewing the Daily Digest, which shows:
- Vehicles requiring price adjustments
- New market opportunities
- Recent sales performance
- Market trend changes

### Scenario 2: Inventory Assessment

The dealer reviews their current inventory:
- Identifies underperforming vehicles
- Reviews pricing recommendations
- Makes decisions on pricing adjustments
- Assesses aging inventory

### Scenario 3: Acquisition Research

The dealer looks for new vehicles to acquire:
- Browses market opportunities
- Analyzes potential profit
- Asks questions about specific models
- Compares opportunities against current inventory

### Scenario 4: Market Analysis

The dealer explores market trends:
