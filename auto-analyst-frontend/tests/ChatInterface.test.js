/**
 * Chat Interface tests - Manual Test Plan
 * 
 * Since this is a complex React component with external dependencies,
 * we'll define manual test cases to follow as we test the application.
 */

/**
 * Test Case 1: Chat Interface Loads Properly
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/chat (or the current port)
 * 2. Verify the chat interface loads without errors
 * 3. Verify the "Ask a question..." input field is visible
 * 4. Verify the welcome message is displayed
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Chat interface loads without any console errors
 * - Input field is visible and enabled
 * - Welcome message encourages users to ask a question
 */

/**
 * Test Case 2: Send a Basic Question and Receive Response
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Type "What vehicles are in the inventory?" in the input field
 * 2. Press Enter or click the send button
 * 3. Observe loading state
 * 4. Wait for response
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Message appears in chat
 * - Loading indicator is shown
 * - AI responds with information about vehicles in inventory
 * - Response references data from the vehicles.csv file
 */

/**
 * Test Case 3: Model Provider Settings
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Verify model provider is set to Gemini (pre-configured)
 * 2. Ask a complex question that requires reasoning
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Model responds appropriately demonstrating reasoning capability
 * - No authentication/API key issues appear
 */

/**
 * Test Case 4: Data Analysis Question
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Type "Analyze the market data and tell me which vehicles are priced below market value"
 * 2. Press Enter
 * 3. Wait for response
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Response contains information about vehicles priced below market
 * - Response mentions specific models like Toyota Camry and Honda Civic
 * - Information matches what's in market_data.csv
 */

/**
 * Test Case 5: Fallback Behavior
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Disconnect the backend servers (if running)
 * 2. Ask a question about the data
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Chat interface still works
 * - Responds using fallback data instead of throwing errors
 */

/**
 * Test Case 6: No Free Trial Overlay
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Send multiple questions
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - No "Ready to unlock full access?" overlay appears
 * - Can continue asking questions without interruption
