### Automotive Module

The Automotive Module is a specialized component designed for automotive dealerships and businesses to:

1. **Inventory Management**: Track and filter vehicle inventory by make, model, condition, and more
2. **Market Analysis**: Compare inventory prices against market rates to identify pricing opportunities
3. **Opportunity Detection**: Automatically identify undervalued vehicles with profit potential
4. **Statistical Analysis**: View key metrics and visualizations about inventory composition and performance

#### API Endpoints

The automotive module provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/vehicles`: List vehicles with optional filtering
- `GET /api/vehicles/{id}`: Get details for a specific vehicle
- `GET /api/market-data`: Get market pricing data
- `GET /api/market-data/{vehicle_id}`: Get market data for a specific vehicle
- `GET /api/opportunities`: Get undervalued vehicle opportunities
- `GET /api/statistics`: Get statistical overview of inventory

#### Frontend Components

## 🛠️ Roadmap  
The following areas are part of our development roadmap to improve system stability, performance and feature set:

### Short-term Goals
- **Error Handling** – Implement more robust exception handling for API endpoints.
- **Cost Calculation Precision** – Improve floating-point precision in cost calculations.
- **Redis Connection Stability** – Enhance connection handling with better fallback mechanisms.
- **User Accounts Page** – Implement email change functionality, plan updates, and other account management features.

### Mid-term Goals  
- **Query Performance** – Optimize agents to be more efficient and reduce hallucinated results on low tier models.
- **API Key Rotation** – Implement automated API key rotation for enhanced security.
- **User Guest Creation in DB** - Fix excessive creation of guest users when users first log in.

### Long-term Goals
Our long-term vision is explained in three principles we would like to follow while developing the latest versions of the product. It is hard to define them in specifics.

- **Usability**: We want the product to be as usable as possible, which can only be achieved through constant experimentation. The optimal UX for such a project is yet to be discovered.
- **Community-driven**: We want input from data analysts and scientists from around the world to guide us in our future development efforts. Please stay in touch on our socials (LinkedIn, Medium, Substack).
- **Openness**: We would like to not only open-source the source code but also, through blogs and other forms of communication, share with the world all advancements in the product openly.
