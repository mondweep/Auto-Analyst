## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap  
The following areas are part of our development roadmap to improve system stability, performance and feature set:

### Short-term Goals
- **Error Handling** ‚Äì Implement more robust exception handling for API endpoints.
- **Cost Calculation Precision** ‚Äì Improve floating-point precision in cost calculations.
- **Redis Connection Stability** ‚Äì Enhance connection handling with better fallback mechanisms.
- **User Accounts Page** ‚Äì Implement email change functionality, plan updates, and other account management features.

### Mid-term Goals  
- **Query Performance** ‚Äì Optimize agents to be more efficient and reduce hallucinated results on low tier models.
- **API Key Rotation** ‚Äì Implement automated API key rotation for enhanced security.
- **User Guest Creation in DB** - Fix excessive creation of guest users when users first log in.

### Long-term Goals
Our long-term vision is explained in three principles we would like to follow while developing the latest versions of the product. It is hard to define them in specifics.

- **Usability**: We want the product to be as usable as possible, which can only be achieved through constant experimentation. The optimal UX for such a project is yet to be discovered.
- **Community-driven**: We want input from data analysts and scientists from around the world to guide us in our future development efforts. Please stay in touch on our socials (LinkedIn, Medium, Substack).
- **Openness**: We would like to not only open-source the source code but also, through blogs and other forms of communication, share with the world all advancements in the product openly.
